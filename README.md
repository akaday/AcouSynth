# AcouSynth

## Features and Capabilities

AcouSynth is a powerful and flexible tool designed for both sound design and acoustic analysis. It bridges the gap between theoretical acoustics and practical sound synthesis, making it a valuable resource for music producers, sound designers, and researchers in acoustics or vocal synthesis.

### Advanced Synthesis Techniques

AcouSynth includes advanced synthesis techniques for generating harmonic sounds and formants. These techniques allow users to create rich and complex sounds with precise control over their harmonic content and formant structures.

### Combining Sine Waves and Noise Components

AcouSynth now includes the capability to combine sine waves and noise components. This feature allows users to create more complex and realistic sounds by blending harmonic synthesis with noise elements. The user interface in Phase 1 provides controls for basic harmonic synthesis and noise filtering, making it user-friendly and accessible for sound creation.

## Integration of Theoretical Acoustics with Practical Synthesis

AcouSynth integrates theoretical acoustics with practical synthesis, providing users with a comprehensive toolset for sound design and analysis. This integration allows for the creation of sounds that are both scientifically accurate and musically expressive.

## Harmonic Sounds and Formants Module

The Harmonic Sounds and Formants module in AcouSynth is designed to handle harmonic sounds and formants effectively. This module provides functions for generating harmonic sounds and formants, giving users the ability to create and manipulate these sounds with ease.

### Usage and Capabilities

The Harmonic Sounds and Formants module includes the following features:
- Functions for generating harmonic sounds with precise control over harmonic content
- Functions for generating formants with adjustable formant structures
- Functions for generating noise components and combining them with sine waves
- Integration with other modules in AcouSynth for seamless sound design and analysis
