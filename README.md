# AcouSynth

## Features and Capabilities

AcouSynth is a powerful and flexible tool designed for both sound design and acoustic analysis. It bridges the gap between theoretical acoustics and practical sound synthesis, making it a valuable resource for music producers, sound designers, and researchers in acoustics or vocal synthesis.

### Advanced Synthesis Techniques

AcouSynth includes advanced synthesis techniques for generating harmonic sounds and formants. These techniques allow users to create rich and complex sounds with precise control over their harmonic content and formant structures.

### Combining Sine Waves and Noise Components

AcouSynth now includes the capability to combine sine waves and noise components. This feature allows users to create more complex and realistic sounds by blending harmonic synthesis with noise elements. The user interface in Phase 1 provides controls for basic harmonic synthesis and noise filtering, making it user-friendly and accessible for sound creation.

## Integration of Theoretical Acoustics with Practical Synthesis

AcouSynth integrates theoretical acoustics with practical synthesis, providing users with a comprehensive toolset for sound design and analysis. This integration allows for the creation of sounds that are both scientifically accurate and musically expressive.

## Harmonic Sounds and Formants Module

The Harmonic Sounds and Formants module in AcouSynth is designed to handle harmonic sounds and formants effectively. This module provides functions for generating harmonic sounds and formants, giving users the ability to create and manipulate these sounds with ease.

### Usage and Capabilities

The Harmonic Sounds and Formants module includes the following features:
- Functions for generating harmonic sounds with precise control over harmonic content
- Functions for generating formants with adjustable formant structures
- Functions for generating noise components and combining them with sine waves
- Integration with other modules in AcouSynth for seamless sound design and analysis

## FFTW Integration

AcouSynth now uses FFTW or PyFFTW for FFT computation, providing optimized performance for real-time analysis. This integration ensures efficient and accurate frequency spectrum analysis, making it a valuable tool for both sound design and acoustic analysis.

### Benefits of FFTW Integration

- Improved performance for FFT computation
- Compatibility with existing code and functionality
- Optimized data handling to minimize memory usage and improve efficiency
- Parallel processing techniques to speed up FFT computation for large datasets
- Robust handling of edge cases and input data validation

## Noise Filtering for Formants

AcouSynth includes a feature for noise filtering to create formants. This allows users to add noise components (such as white, pink, or brown noise) and filter them to create formants, emulating the resonant frequencies of vocal tract shapes or instrument bodies.

## Flexible Spectral Envelope

AcouSynth provides tools to manipulate the spectral envelope to shape the timbre of the sound over time. Users can utilize filter banks, spectral shaping, and smoothing functions to dynamically adjust the soundâ€™s character.

## Effects Modules

AcouSynth includes advanced sound design techniques such as:
- Subharmonics: Generate lower harmonics for deeper tones.
- Jitter Effects: Introduce random variations in pitch, amplitude, or timing for more organic or "shaky" sound characteristics.
- Pitch Modulation: Control pitch bending and vibrato effects.

## Syllabic Sound Generation

AcouSynth allows users to create sound sequences representing human vocalizations by combining basic sounds (such as vowels or consonants) into syllabic structures. This feature enables the synthesis of synthetic speech, vocal-like sounds, or speech-like textures in non-verbal contexts (e.g., sound design for film or virtual environments).

## Real-Time Acoustic Analysis

AcouSynth implements real-time tools for spectral analysis (Fourier Transforms, spectrograms). Users can analyze harmonic structure, noise characteristics, and dynamic changes in sound over time.

## Parameter Control

AcouSynth provides a user interface (either graphical or code-based) to manipulate parameters such as:
- Amplitude envelopes
- Harmonic content (fundamental frequency and overtones)
- Noise components (spectrum and intensity)
- Formant frequencies (for vocal-like sound)
- Temporal evolution (attack, sustain, decay, and release)

## New Features and Capabilities

AcouSynth has been enhanced with new features and capabilities to further improve its functionality and versatility. These new features include:

- Synthetic Speech Generation: AcouSynth can now generate synthetic speech using advanced synthesis techniques. This feature allows users to create realistic and expressive speech sounds for various applications.
